	<h2>What is this about</h2>
		<p>So I'm making a project today, and it's needs to be about something I care about.
		
	
		<p>He is 3 years old and I've had for 2 years. His favorite thing to do is to play fetch.</p>
		<p>I would show a video of him chasing a ball but I can't get the video to work.</p>
		<p>He likes to play with tennis balls but he LOVES to play with tennis ball that squeak.</p>

	<h2>How did I learn this</h2>
		<p>I learned this by all the lessons I've been doing for homeschool for the HTML and
		 computer class, and I did so many lessons.
